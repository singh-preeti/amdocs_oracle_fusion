1.  SELECT Id, Name, Department, Salary, Gender, Age, City FROM Employee;
2. Retrieve Specific Columns from Employee table
  SELECT Id, Name, Department, Salary FROM Employee;
3. SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Gender = ‘Male’;
4. SELECT Id, Name, Department, Salary, Gender, Age, City FROM Employee WHERE Gender = ‘Male’;
5. SELECT DISTINCT Statement in Oracle
  1. SELECT Distinct Department FROM Employee;
  2. SELECT Distinct Department, Salary FROM Employee;
6. Alias Names in Oracle:
  I) Column Level:
At this level, we are creating alias names on columns. The syntax is given below.
<column name> <column alias name>
Example: Department Dept

II) Table Level:
In this level, we create alias names on the table. The syntax is given below.
<table name> <table alias name>
Example: Employee Emp
7. SELECT Id, Name, Department Dept, Salary Sal FROM Employee Emp;
8. Concatenation Operator (||) in Oracle:
   Select ‘Welcome’||’ ‘||’to Oracle’ from dual;
   Select ‘Mr.’||Name||’ ‘||’Salary is’||’ ‘||Salary from Employee;
9. Copy in Oracle 
  CREATE TABLE Employee1 AS SELECT * FROM Employee;
  CREATE TABLE Employee2 AS SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE 1 = 0;

10. Merge Command in Oracle:
It is a DML command (oracle 9i). It is used to transfer data from the source table to the destination table. If data is matching in both tables, then those matching data /rows are overridden on the destination table by using the “UPDATE” command whereas if data is not matching then those unmatching data/rows are transferred from the source table to the destination table by using the “INSERT” command.

  1. SELECT * FROM Employee;
  2. CREATE TABLE Employee3 AS SELECT * FROM Employee;
  3. INSERT INTO Employee3 (Id, Name, Department, Salary, Gender, Age, City) VALUES (1011, ‘Kumar’, ‘IT’, 55000, ‘Male’, 27, ‘London’);

INSERT INTO Employee3 (Id, Name, Department, Salary, Gender, Age, City) VALUES (1012, ‘Santosh’, ‘HR’, 70000, ‘Female’, 29, ‘Mumbai’);

  4. SELECT * FROM Employee3; Source Table
     SELECT * FROM Employee; Old Table
  5. MERGE INTO Employee d using Employee3 s on(d.Id = s.Id)
when matched then 
update set d.Name=s.Name, d.City=s.City,d.Department=s.Department, d.Salary=s.Salary, d.Age=s.Age, d.Gender=s.Gender
when not matched then
Insert(d.ID, d.Name, d.Department, d.City, d.Salary, d.Age, d.Gender)values(s.Id, s.Name, s.Department, s.City, s.Salary, s.Age, s.Gender);
